Certainly! Let's dive into each part of your question:

1. **Weglot and Multilingual Websites**:
   - Weglot is a powerful WordPress plugin that allows you to create multilingual websites easily. However, it's not entirely free; it offers both free and paid plans.
   - Here's a breakdown of Weglot's pricing:
     - **Free Plan**: If your website has less than 2,000 words, you can use Weglot for free. It includes one translated language and limited support.
     - **Paid Plans**: If you need more features or want to translate more content, Weglot offers several paid plans with varying word limits and additional capabilities. These plans start at ‚Ç¨15 per month and go up to custom enterprise plans¬π.
   - If you're looking for a free alternative, consider using online translation tools like OpenL Translate or Yandex Translate. These tools allow you to translate text, including website content, from English to Arabic. Keep in mind that while machine translations can be helpful, they may not always capture the nuances perfectly, so manual review is essential‚Åµ‚Å∑.

2. **Writing Blog Posts in Arabic**:
   - Writing blog posts in Arabic involves understanding the Arabic script, which is written from right to left. Here are some steps to help you get started:
     - **Learn the Arabic Alphabet**: Familiarize yourself with the 28 letters of the Arabic alphabet. Practice pronunciation and writing.
     - **Understand Letter Forms**: Each Arabic letter has different forms based on its position in a word (independent, initial, medial, or final). Learn these variations.
     - **Practice Words**: Start by writing simple words. Pay attention to how letters connect and change forms within a word.
     - **Work on Sentence Structure**: As you gain confidence, write sentences. Arabic typically follows a Verb-Subject-Object sequence.
     - **Explore Arabic Calligraphy**: If you want to add an artistic touch, explore Arabic calligraphy styles like Naskh or Thuluth. Calligraphy enhances the beauty of the script¬π‚Å∂.

3. **Translating Blog Posts Properly**:
   - When translating your existing English blog posts into Arabic, consider the following:
     - **Quality Translation**: Avoid relying solely on machine translation. While it can provide a starting point, manually review and refine the translations to ensure accuracy.
     - **Cultural Nuances**: Be aware of cultural differences. Some expressions or idioms may not directly translate, so adapt the content to resonate with an Arabic-speaking audience.
     - **SEO Considerations**: Optimize your translated content for Arabic keywords related to your programming topics. Research relevant Arabic terms to improve SEO.
     - **Hreflang Tags**: If you're using multiple language versions on your website, implement hreflang tags correctly to signal to search engines which language version to display in specific regions¬π‚Å¥.

Remember, creating a multilingual website involves more than just translation‚Äîit's about connecting with a global audience and respecting cultural diversity. Happy blogging! üåê‚ú® Is there anything else you'd like to explore or discuss further? üòä
