  - Array operations: Sorting, searching, and iterating through arrays.
- **Strings:**
  - String manipulation: Concatenation, comparison, and methods from the `String` class (`substring()`, `indexOf()`, `length()`, etc.).
  - Immutable vs mutable strings.
  
**Practical Application:**  
- Create a program to reverse an array or string.
- Implement a basic sorting algorithm (e.g., bubble sort or selection sort).

### **4. Functions/Methods (Intermediate)**  
**Goal:** Understand how to write reusable code with functions and parameters.  
**Topics to Cover:**
- **Defining and Calling Methods:** Method structure, return types, parameters, and overloading.
- **Scope of Variables:** Local vs global scope, method parameters, and return values.

**Practical Application:**  
- Build a simple calculator using methods for each arithmetic operation.
- Implement recursive solutions (e.g., calculating factorial or Fibonacci series).

### **5. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles (Intermediate to Advanced)**  
**Goal:** Grasp OOP principles and how they are implemented in Java.  
**Topics to Cover:**
- **Classes and Objects:**
  - Defining classes, fields, methods, and constructors.
  - Access modifiers (`private`, `public`, `protected`, `default`).
  - Creating objects and accessing class members.
- **Four Pillars of OOP:**
  - **Encapsulation:** Using getters and setters to control access to class fields.
  - **Inheritance:** `extends` keyword, method overriding, and super keyword.
  - **Polymorphism:** Compile-time (method overloading) and runtime (method overriding).
  - **Abstraction:** Abstract classes and interfaces.
  
**Practical Application:**  
- Create a class hierarchy for a simple school system (Student, Teacher, Course).
- Implement polymorphism by designing a shape hierarchy (e.g., Circle, Rectangle).

### **6. Exception Handling and File I/O (Intermediate)**  
**Goal:** Handle errors gracefully and work with file input/output.  
**Topics to Cover:**
- **Exception Handling:**
  - Try-catch blocks, multiple exceptions, and finally block.
  - Custom exceptions.
- **File I/O:**
  - Reading and writing text files using `FileReader`, `FileWriter`, `BufferedReader`, and `BufferedWriter`.
  
**Practical Application:**  
- Write a program that reads from a text file and displays its content.
- Implement a program that catches and handles user input errors.

### **7. Collections Framework and Generics (Advanced)**  
**Goal:** Work with data structures beyond arrays using Java's Collections Framework.  
**Topics to Cover:**
- **Lists, Sets, and Maps:**
  - `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `HashSet`, `TreeSet`, `HashMap`, and `TreeMap`.
- **Iterators and Enhanced For-Loops.**
- **Generics:** Defining generic classes and methods.
  
**Practical Application:**  
- Build a simple student information system using `ArrayList`.
- Use a `HashMap` to create a phonebook application.

### **8. Java Concurrency (Advanced)**  
**Goal:** Understand multithreading and concurrent programming.  
**Topics to Cover:**
- **Threads and Runnable Interface.**
- **Synchronization and Locking.**
- **ExecutorService and Futures.**
  
**Practical Application:**  
- Create a multi-threaded Java program that simulates a task manager.
- Use the `ExecutorService` to manage a pool of threads.

### **9. Java Web Development (Advanced)**  
**Goal:** Learn how to build dynamic web applications using Java.  
**Topics to Cover:**
- **Servlets and JSP:**
  - Setting up a basic Java web application.
  - Handling requests and responses using servlets.
  - Working with JSP for dynamic web pages.
- **Java EE and Spring Framework:**
  - Introduction to Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition) for large-scale applications.
  - Setting up Spring Boot applications, dependency injection, and MVC pattern.
  
**Practical Application:**  
- Build a basic CRUD web application using servlets and JSP.
- Implement a REST API with Spring Boot.

### **10. Database Connectivity (Advanced)**  
**Goal:** Integrate your Java applications with databases for persistent data storage.  
**Topics to Cover:**
- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity):**
  - Connecting to databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
  - Executing queries and handling result sets.
