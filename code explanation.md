Certainly! Let's break down the given code snippet and understand how Java's access modifiers work in this context.

1. **Access Modifiers in Java**:
   - Access modifiers control the visibility and accessibility of class members (fields, methods, and inner classes). They determine which parts of a class can be accessed from other classes or packages.
   - Java has four main access modifiers:
     - `private`: The member is accessible only within its own class.
     - `default` (no modifier): The member is accessible only within classes in the same package.
     - `protected`: The member is accessible within its own package and by subclasses (even if they are in different packages).
     - `public`: The member is accessible from any other class, regardless of package.

2. **Explanation of the Code**:
   - The class `AccessModifiers` defines several instance variables (fields) and a method.
   - Let's look at each part:

     ```java
     public class AccessModifiers {
         private int privateVar = 1;
         int defaultVar = 2;
         protected int protectedVar = 3;
         public int publicVar = 4;

         public void display() {
             System.out.println("Private: " + privateVar);
             System.out.println("Default: " + defaultVar);
             System.out.println("Protected: " + protectedVar);
             System.out.println("Public: " + publicVar);
         }
     }
     ```

   - `privateVar`: This field is marked as `private`. It can only be accessed within the `AccessModifiers` class itself. No other class can directly access or modify it.
   - `defaultVar`: This field has no explicit access modifier (i.e., it's the default). It is accessible within the same package (since there's no modifier), but not from classes in other packages.
   - `protectedVar`: This field is marked as `protected`. It is accessible within the same package and also by subclasses (even if they are in different packages).
   - `publicVar`: This field is marked as `public`. It is accessible from any other class, regardless of package.
   - The `display()` method is also `public`, so it can be called from any other class.

3. **Example Usage**:
   - Suppose we have another class called `Main` in the same package:
     ```java
     public class Main {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             AccessModifiers obj = new AccessModifiers();
             obj.display();
             System.out.println("Public var from Main: " + obj.publicVar);
         }
     }
     ```
   - In this example, we create an instance of `AccessModifiers` and call its `display()` method. We can also directly access the `publicVar`.

4. **Summary**:
   - Access modifiers help enforce encapsulation and control the visibility of class members. Use them wisely based on your design goals and security requirements.
